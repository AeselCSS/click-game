# click-game
## About:
This basic click-game is made as a part of my programming course @ KEA Copenhagen.
The purpose is to gain introduction-level knowledge to html, css and javascript.

## Idea:
Basic 2d game with various moving objects that either has to be clicked on or leaved not clicked in order to succeed.
